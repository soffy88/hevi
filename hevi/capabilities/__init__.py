"""Hevi unified capability registry — public surface.

Importing this package must NOT trigger heavy side effects (no chromium
launch, no ffmpeg).  Capability *registration* is explicit via
:func:`hevi.capabilities.scene3d.register_scene3d_capabilities`, called by the
line's bootstrap so the catalogue is populated lazily and testably.
